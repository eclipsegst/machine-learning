Week 1

# Introduction

Welcome to Machine Learning! In this module, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using dataâ€”without being explicitly programmed. The Course Wiki is under construction. Please visit the resources tab for the most complete and up-to-date information.

# Linear Regression with One Variable

Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.

# Linear Algebra Review

This optional module provides a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables.
